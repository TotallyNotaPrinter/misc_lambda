# misc_lambda
variety of useful lambdas

Each lambda will be in it's own folder with it's own readme
The readme in each nested foler will have descriptions of the logic therein
All have been tested and are confirmed to work

short list of lambdas:
    - A pair of lambdas that do two things. One kicks off Vuln scans on each image in each ECR repo in your account, the other ships the findings to SQS
    - A lambda that is designed to bridge the gap between Blue / Green Deploys in ECS and Application AutoScaling Target Tracking Policies
